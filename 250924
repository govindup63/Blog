today is my exam and I am still not studying. yay

Q- My reasons start a public blog
    Green github ðŸ¤‘
    Discipline (maybe)
    a platform to articulate my thoughts
    maybe get better at writting english(i am very bad with spellings....and grammar too...and english tooðŸ˜­)

TOTD:
  well i have startded many journals but never stick to those and left writting after day or two
  But this time (like i always say but never obey) i will try to maintain it properly.
  
  So i have exams tommorow and i am wasting time writting this. Which makes me think that do i even like 
  engineering? and the ans is no unfortunately. If a ginnie grants me 3 wishesh then my first wish will be
  infine attendence. 

  okay enough yaping. its time for git push
  fuck exams
